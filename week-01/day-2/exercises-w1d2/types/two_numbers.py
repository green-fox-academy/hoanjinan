# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13
num_1 = 13
num_2 = 22
# Print the result of 13 added to 22
result = num_1 + num_2
print(result)
# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22
result = num_2 - num_1
print(result)
# Print the result of 22 multiplied by 13
result = num_2 * num_1
print(result)
# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)
result = num_2 / num_1
print(result)
# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13
result = num_2 // num_1
print(result)
# Print the remainder of 22 divided by 13
result = num_2 % num_1
print(result)
